# Machine Learning Fundamentals

## Topic 2: Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine Learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It's a branch of AI based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

### Types of Machine Learning

1. **Supervised Learning**: The model learns from labeled training data
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: The model finds patterns in unlabeled data
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: The model learns through trial and error with rewards

### Common Algorithms

- **Linear Regression**: Used for predicting continuous values
- **Logistic Regression**: Used for binary classification
- **Decision Trees**: Used for both classification and regression
- **Neural Networks**: Used for complex pattern recognition

### Applications

- Image and speech recognition
- Recommendation systems
- Predictive analytics
- Autonomous vehicles

### Key Considerations

When implementing machine learning solutions, it's important to consider data quality, model selection, and evaluation metrics. The success of a machine learning project often depends more on the quality of the data than the sophistication of the algorithm.
