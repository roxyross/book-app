# Computer Vision and Image Processing

## Topic 1: Fundamentals of Computer Vision

Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world. Using digital images from cameras and videos and deep learning models, machines can accurately identify and classify objects and react to what they "see."

### Core Concepts

- **Image Classification**: Identifying what object is in an image
- **Object Detection**: Locating and identifying multiple objects in an image
- **Image Segmentation**: Partitioning an image into multiple segments
- **Feature Extraction**: Identifying distinctive features in images

### Traditional Techniques

- Edge detection algorithms
- Corner detection methods
- Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)
- Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)

## Topic 2: Deep Learning in Computer Vision

Deep learning has transformed computer vision by enabling end-to-end learning of image features, leading to unprecedented accuracy in visual recognition tasks.

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

CNNs are specifically designed for processing grid-like data such as images. They use convolutional layers to automatically detect important features without human intervention.

### Architectures

- LeNet: Early CNN architecture
- AlexNet: Introduced deep learning to computer vision
- VGGNet: Deeper and more accurate
- ResNet: Introduced residual connections
- EfficientNet: Optimized for efficiency and accuracy

### Applications

- Medical imaging
- Autonomous vehicles
- Facial recognition
- Quality control in manufacturing
