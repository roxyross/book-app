# Modern NLP Models

## Topic 2: Modern NLP Models

Contemporary NLP has been revolutionized by transformer architectures and pre-trained models that can be fine-tuned for specific tasks.

### Transformer Architecture

The transformer model uses self-attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence, allowing for better context understanding.

### Pre-trained Models

- BERT: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers
- GPT: Generative Pre-trained Transformer
- T5: Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer

### Attention Mechanisms

Attention allows models to focus on relevant parts of the input when making predictions, improving performance on long sequences.

### Fine-tuning Approaches

- Task-specific fine-tuning
- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA, adapters)
- Few-shot learning
- Zero-shot learning

### Applications

- Machine translation
- Text summarization
- Question answering systems
- Chatbots and virtual assistants
