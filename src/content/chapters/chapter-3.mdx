# Natural Language Processing

## Topic 1: Foundations of NLP

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a valuable way.

### Core Components

- **Tokenization**: Breaking text into individual words or phrases
- **Part-of-speech tagging**: Identifying grammatical roles of words
- **Named Entity Recognition**: Identifying and classifying named entities
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determining the emotional tone of text

### Preprocessing Techniques

- Text normalization
- Stop word removal
- Stemming and lemmatization
- Handling out-of-vocabulary words

## Topic 2: Modern NLP Models

Contemporary NLP has been revolutionized by transformer architectures and pre-trained models that can be fine-tuned for specific tasks.

### Transformer Architecture

The transformer model uses self-attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence, allowing for better context understanding.

### Pre-trained Models

- BERT: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers
- GPT: Generative Pre-trained Transformer
- T5: Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer

### Applications

- Machine translation
- Text summarization
- Question answering systems
- Chatbots and virtual assistants
