# Deep Learning Applications

## Topic 2: Deep Learning Applications

Deep learning involves neural networks with multiple hidden layers. This allows the network to learn complex patterns and representations from data.

### Key Applications

- Computer vision and image recognition
- Natural language processing
- Speech recognition
- Medical diagnosis
- Financial forecasting

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

CNNs are specialized for processing grid-like data such as images. They use convolutional layers to automatically detect important features without human intervention.

### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

RNNs are designed for sequential data like time series or natural language. They maintain internal state to process sequences of inputs.

### Challenges

- Requires large amounts of data
- Computationally expensive
- Difficult to interpret results
- Prone to overfitting

### Future Directions

The field continues to evolve with new architectures like Transformers and attention mechanisms that have revolutionized natural language processing.
