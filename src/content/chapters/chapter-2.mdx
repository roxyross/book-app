# Neural Networks and Deep Learning

## Topic 1: Neural Network Architecture

Neural networks are computing systems inspired by the human brain. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information using dynamic state responses to external inputs.

### Basic Structure

- **Input Layer**: Receives the initial data
- **Hidden Layers**: Process the data through weighted connections
- **Output Layer**: Produces the final result

### Activation Functions

- **Sigmoid**: Maps values to a range between 0 and 1
- **ReLU**: Rectified Linear Unit, commonly used in deep learning
- **Tanh**: Hyperbolic tangent, similar to sigmoid but ranges from -1 to 1

## Topic 2: Deep Learning Applications

Deep learning involves neural networks with multiple hidden layers. This allows the network to learn complex patterns and representations from data.

### Key Applications

- Computer vision and image recognition
- Natural language processing
- Speech recognition
- Medical diagnosis
- Financial forecasting

### Challenges

- Requires large amounts of data
- Computationally expensive
- Difficult to interpret results
- Prone to overfitting
