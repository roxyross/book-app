# Introduction to AI and Machine Learning

## Topic 1: What is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. The ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take actions that have the best chance of achieving a specific goal.

### Key Concepts

- **Machine Learning**: A subset of AI that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed
- **Deep Learning**: A subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers
- **Natural Language Processing**: The ability of machines to understand and interpret human language

### Historical Context

AI has evolved significantly since its inception in the 1950s. Early AI systems were rule-based, but modern AI relies heavily on data-driven approaches and neural networks.

## Topic 2: Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine Learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It's a branch of AI based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

### Types of Machine Learning

1. **Supervised Learning**: The model learns from labeled training data
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: The model finds patterns in unlabeled data
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: The model learns through trial and error with rewards

### Applications

- Image and speech recognition
- Recommendation systems
- Predictive analytics
- Autonomous vehicles
